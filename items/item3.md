## UX 201 DIY Project 2

#### Group Maker Lab DIY Project: We Wheels


 <div align="center">  
In this project me and my group did a DIY project for UX 201 where we had to create something that helped address a social issue. 
<br>
As a group we decided to create the We Wheels! We Wheels is an all in one  all terrain mobile wheelchair with many unique features. Our aim for designing this DIY maker project was to make a wheelchair that doesn't stop a user from going anywhere! We decided to design the We Wheels,  while keeping accessibility, inclusion, and fairness  for all users.
<br>
In a COVID world those who need assistance might not have someone to help  them get around. So it was important to us as a group that we designed a DIY project that allows users to be more mobile independently if needed. Unfortunately many buildings, neighborhoods, and public spaces aren't fully equipped with ramps and accessible for wheelchair users. So we decided to design a wheelchair that has all features a user would need to be independent and mobile.

## My Angle

My role in this project was to prototype our design and make changes through the iterative design process. I helped brainstorm ideas, created the final design document, as well as doing a presentation. 

Some inspiration for our designs came from:
