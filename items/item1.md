Hello! My name is Samer, and I am a User Experience Designer! I am from Toronto, studying at Laurier to become a UX designer. UX has been something I have been passionate about since I discovered what it was. My goal is to build and create human-centred products that ensure users are thought of and leaving with a positive satisfying experience. As a UX designer I am feedback driven! I like to solve problems collaboratively, working with all team members and stakeholders to ensure the work is done to satisfy all members.
