## UX 201 Project

#### Group Maker Lab Box Project: Bored Box


 <div align="center">  
This project was something me and my group did for UX 201 where we had to hack the idea of a box into something with another purpose. When thinking about ways to best hack a box, we thought of many different possibilities. 
<br>
What we did as a team was design the idea of the Bored Box. . The bored box consists of six of the most popular board games in the world on one box. Each face of the box will feature one game. The inside of the bored box will have twelve slots for game materials and pieces and well as extra slots for storage of other games. The games featured on this box are Monopoly, The Game of Life, Scrabble, Snakes and Ladders, Connect Four, Chess and Checkers.
<br>
 The bored box is accessible, all in one entertainment box for family and friends. Our aim for hacking this box was to bring people together through fun activities and games. In a COVID world, we find ourselves having lots of down time at home with family or roommates. We designed and hacked the bored box to bring fun and entertainment anywhere you go or even just at your home!

## My Angle

When it came to this project, my role was delegating tasks to group members to make sure every process in our design sprint was hit. I was responsible for figuring out our objectives and aim, leading the brainstorming process, as well as making sure everything was done correctly before finishing.
