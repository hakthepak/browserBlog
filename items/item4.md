## UX 230 Design Brief 

#### Group Design Brief Project: Friend Fit


 <div align="center">  
In this project me and my group did a design brief for an app targeted to users of fitness devices.We came up with our app named the Friend Fit, an idea through conversations with our peers about fitness tracking and those that wanted to move from apple watch to fit bit or vice versa told us how frustrating it was that their data was not synced.
<br>
As a group we decided to create an app that shows users better insights based on their activities, as well as one that has a social component!

## My Angle

My role in this project to conduct research and interviews with users of these devices. I helped brainstorm ideas, created the final design document, as well as doing a presentation. I also helped with the prototyping of our app design.
